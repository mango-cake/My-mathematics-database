# My-mathematics-database
This is for a math website I am hoping to complete by the end of October. Instead of teaching normal types of math like any average mathematician,on my website, I will be discussing special topics in mathematics that are overlooked by most people. These types of properties and principals are not like other theorems and conjectures. Hope you enjoy!
