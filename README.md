# My-mathematics-database
This is for a math website I am hoping to complete by the end of August! My database will be called: Mango's Mathematics! It is going to showcase a plethera of math skills and units, especially topics surrounding Algebra (1 & 2), Geometry, Triganometry, and much, much more. I hope that this website can help youn better understand different types of math. :)
